# A messenger bot for group money splitting on Starling

## TODO

- [ ] Leave group functionality
- [ ] Add a way to add a new user to a group after creating a group
- [ ] Add a functionality where a user can get many invites and accept/decline them
- [ ] Add a way to take the username from a starling split link instead of just asking for it at the start
